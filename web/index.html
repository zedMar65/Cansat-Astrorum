            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>CanSat Astrorum is a project that aims to develop a CanSat, a small satellite that fits inside a soda can, to be launched in the near future. The CanSat will be equipped with sensors to measure temperature, humidity, pressure, and altitude. The data collected by the CanSat will be transmitted to a ground station for analysis. The project is being developed by a team of students from the University of Bras√≠lia, in Brazil.</p>
